About the Author
Thank you.
A number of people have enriched and made this project possible...
I want to first express my love and gratitude to my partner, Heidi, and
daughter, Mila, for their love and support throughout my writing of this book.
Heidi, in your hands this book took shape, through late night conversations,
careful edits, and the priceless gift of time. As a family, we can accomplish
anything, and I look forward to a lifetime of adventures together.
Adam, as my friend and colleague you have challenged me to be the best
version of myself. Best of all, you helped me see that we can change the world,
one day, one lesson, one tweet at a time.
Any explorer on a voyage is helped by all the fellow travelers and those who
pass by along their way. I couldn’t have got to this point on my lifelong voyage
without my Professional Learning Network. Whether as close colleagues at
University School of Milwaukee or virtual partners around the world they all
inspired and helped me.
Lastly, the students and their legacies. They made it happen. They stepped
away from average and created something extraordinary. The journey, the grind,
and the hustle are by no means easy but they put in the time and reached for
greatness. This is truly what the New World of education is all about.
Are You a Pirate?
Teaching like a pirate has nothing to do with the dictionary definition of a
pirate and everything to do with the spirit. Pirates are daring, adventurous, and
willing to set forth into uncharted waters with no guarantee of success. They
reject the status quo and refuse to conform to any society that stifles creativity or
limits independence. They are explorers who take risks and are willing to travel
to the ends of the earth for educational treasure. They yearn for adventure and
are constantly searching the horizon for new opportunities.
Teaching like a pirate is, quite simply, a way of looking at the world.
Educational pirates relentlessly seek and discover what engages people and then
ask, “How can I use that in my classroom?”
There is no denying the enormous pull that gaming has on many youth today.
Therefore, the pirate philosophy demands that we examine what makes gaming
so engaging and then explore the multitude of ways we can incorporate those
elements into our instruction to create enthralling learning experiences for
students. This manifesto by Michael Matera on gamification and game-inspired
course design is the start of an awesome adventure that may just change your
classroom forever.
Best wishes from the captain as you embark and learn to explore like a pirate.

Part I: Plotting the Course
Don’t tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let
them surprise you with their results.
—George S. Patton, Jr.
1: The Call of the Explorer: Discover the Adventure
that Awaits
Exploration is really the essence of the human spirit.
—Frank Borman
Are you ready to explore gamification and game-based learning? Are you
ready to set sail and transform your classroom into an experiential world that
flourishes on collaboration and creativity? I believe you are because, even if you
simply picked up this book out of curiosity, you have already experienced the
engaging power of creative play.
Now, imagine creative play that is based in content acquisition and student
experience. Imagine what it would be like to facilitate an environment where
learning knows no borders, no limits, and where maximizing the potential of
your students is a reality. Intrigued? Then weigh anchor and hoist the mizzen
because together we are going to venture into the seas of gamification. In these
first few pages, you will come to realize that this innovative teaching tool is not
only possible, but it is also a shipshape way to give life to course content and
purpose to students’ lives in the classroom and beyond.
In recent years, I have been fortunate enough to travel across the United
States to present on the topic of gamification and game-based learning. I have
met gifted and passionate innovators who excel at creating and tapping into the
very best resources for their classrooms. These bold educators, along with the
recent pedagogical tools, are shaping the “New World” of education! As a life-
long learner, I am constantly exploring how methods like project-based learning
and blended and flipped teaching can enhance my classroom. Professional
development opportunities, social networks, cutting-edge research, and daily
trial and error help to shape my continually evolving view of the classroom.
These explorative channels directed me towards gamification.
Gamification, done with intention, is a perfect vessel to augment many
pedagogical tools. It allows teachers, students, and administrators to have what I
call an “educational mashup.” Gamification and game-based learning have the
power to amplify what happens in your class. When created with the meat of
rich content, the breath of the current educational movement, and the spirit of
collaboration and creativity, you have a fully functional, dynamically successful
classroom. However, if done without purpose or personal buy-in, “shiver me
timbers!” these ideas are easily forgotten skeletons.
Again, whatever your reason for picking up this book, there is something in
here for you. As a teacher, I know the importance of making game-based
learning tangible in order to get buy-in from students, fellow teachers,
administrators, and parents. As you sail through these pages, you will be
motivated to think outside the spyglass and see beyond the bounds of traditional
teaching methods. You will gain confidence in the many ways gamification
already naturally flows with your existing classroom currents. Even if you only
venture into a few simple gamification techniques, you will discover ways to
maximize your students’ potential and their desire to engage in learning.
Administrators and parents, I know what you’re thinking because you’ve told
me. This cannot be “real learning,” “competition should not be a motivator,” and
“where is the academic rigor?!” I will address all of these and more.
Finally, gamification provides us the avenue to support the expertise that both
teachers and students bring to the classroom. I will share student examples of
gamification and feedback from parents who have experienced the wide-open
seas of cognitive, personal, and social growth. The best part is that gamification
is a collaborative effort that invites opportunities to design and work with
colleagues and educators around the globe because gamification has the power
to transform the way we teach and the way we learn.
So with that said, where do we begin? We first need the confidence to shove
off from the familiar dock.
When first thinking about applying gamification in my classroom, I wasn’t
sure where sea winds would take me. I was even uncertain if taking time to
incorporate gamification was worth the educational benefit. Then I remembered
being a kid and how my classes, while interesting at times, were more often
unmotivating. Like many kids, I wasn’t very inspired by the idea of college
(which seemed so far away)
or by threats about what would happen if I didn’t achieve high letter grades
and test scores.
Gamification has the power to transform the way we teach and
the way we learn.
What tipped the scales for me to give gamification a shot was the following
childhood memory...
It was just another day in middle school in little old Port Washington. The
time was slowly dripping by, and my fellow students and I felt as if we were
merely taking up space. I began to daydream. Looking around, I didn’t see my
classmates; I saw twenty-six secret CIA agents who were uncovering a plot to
destroy the world. We were trained and ready with the skills and knowledge to
defeat “the enemy.”
Our teacher was the CIA Captain, charged with giving us the mission to shut
down this plot. How awesome! I was transported into a larger world, one where
anything was possible, and my classmates and I were at the center of it all!
You will see how game-inspired learning creates fantastical
experiences that tap into endless reservoirs of imagination and
ambition.
Looking back on this childhood memory, I understand now that what I longed
for was adventure. I wanted to be part of something greater. While my
classmates and I wouldn’t have articulated it in this way, what we wanted was an
immersive experience, one that engaged us on all levels. We wanted a risky
mission, in which we could discover the content, come together to overcome
conflicts, and make tension-filled choices that would impact “the game” of
learning.
As you explore gamified opportunities with your students, you will discover
that the power of play in the classroom activates the human spirit and leads to
greater content acquisition and self-motivation. Gamification provides an
environment that awakens the dormant explorer inside each one of us. You and
the students will completely invest in the learning process when your minds,
bodies, and spirits are engaged. Instead of being a captive audience, your
students will be captivated by the adventure of learning. And you will see how
game-inspired learning creates fantastical experiences that tap into endless
reservoirs of imagination and ambition while also supporting a sense of
community through a positive classroom culture.
All the resources you need to gamify your classroom are available within you,
your students, and the community of educators you turn to for insights and
inspiration. This method is accessible to all grade levels, subject areas, and
educational budgets. How? Because you are maximizing what you already have
and what is available to you. You start with the content that meets your required
standards and then explore how to layer gamification over the top. Game-
inspired course design works in tandem with your curriculum standards while
offering ways for students to go beyond the basics.
Gamification is possible in any classroom because creativity is the wind that
powers the sails. Creativity exists inside all of us, even in the toughest
buccaneers to bring on board, because we all have interests, passions, and ideas.
Creativity is foundational in the New World of education and a tool too powerful
to waste. In the pages ahead, we will discover ways students can gain the
invaluable life skills of crafting their own educational journeys and taking
greater responsibility for their knowledge, behaviors, and motivations. You will
learn to create opportunities for students to explore, practice, and embody skills
like confidence, focus, resilience, dependability, curiosity, and empathy while
working collaboratively towards a common goal. Part III of this book provides
basic game theory and mechanics that will empower you to create an
environment that more fully engages students’ motivations to learn while also
producing better results. We, through gamification and playful planning, will
create leaders, critical thinkers, and even legacy makers.
Gamification is possible in any classroom because creativity is the
wind that powers the sails.
Oceanographer Don Walsh described exploration as “curiosity put into
[1]
action.” Be a curious, ambitious explorer as you embark upon the journey of
this book. Allow the ideas to transport you outside your comfort zone and to see
new possibilities in what you are already doing. You may take away a few gold
nuggets or perhaps a treasure chest of ideas to hone your skills and expand your
resources. I encourage you to forge ahead even if, like the early explorers, you
have no idea what awaits you. You may be approaching this with a mixture of
skepticism, fear, and excitement; and yet you are here on the dock because you
also dream of what could be possible when teaching and learning are action
based and inclusive of the individual skills that everyone can contribute.
So take the leap and come aboard. The best explorers were those who had the
drive to understand things that others couldn’t even imagine possible. You know
the content; now let’s infuse game-based strategies that will unlock your
students’ potential and shape their futures.
2: Tall Tales: Dispelling the Myths of Gamification
Understanding is the sum of misunderstandings.
—Haruki Murakami
Still have a toe on the dock? Perhaps misconceptions about gamification are
keeping you from jumping aboard. This chapter will quell your fears by
answering common questions and concerns about game-based learning. What
you’ll learn here will also help you convince administrators, parents, students,
and colleagues—your crew—that this is a journey worth exploring. Get their
buy-in and you’ll be one step closer to setting sail.
So, let’s start with the most common question I hear: What is gamification?
Gamification is applying the most motivational techniques of games to non-
game settings, like classrooms. This simple definition is a great place to begin
the conversation, but there is so much more to this pedagogical tool.
Gamification includes elements of game theory, design thinking, and
informational literacy. It is a framework laid over your curriculum that is fluid
and tangible at all skill levels.
Success comes when we are intentional about the ways we use gamification
in tandem with curriculum standards. What we are essentially doing is an
educational mashup of game-based learning, plus other tried and true methods.
Sailing forward, remember we are using gamification to enhance what we
already do.
Identifying and overcoming the misconceptions about gamification helps
ensure a positive gamified experience for students, parents, and administrators.
Let’s learn from the myths, avoid them, dispel them, and especially not
perpetuate them. The proof will be identifiable when you start seeing positive
results from the beginning.
MYTH #1
Games are just for play. There is no challenge or educational rigor.
TRUTH
Games are filled with a motivational complexity that can be used to
shed light on topics and increase content acquisition.
Serious games, sometimes referred to as applied games, fall into a category of
strategic play with purpose beyond pure entertainment. Do a simple Internet
search, and you will discover that professionals use games to solve real-world
problems in industries like federal defense, education, scientific exploration,
healthcare, emergency management, city planning, engineering, and politics.
Learning by doing, commonly referred to as experiential learning, is a powerful
tool many educators already use. Through games, we allow students to learn
from mistakes, practice both short-and long-term planning, and, best of all,
develop informational literacy skills. Informational literacy is the ability to select
the best option in an ever-changing environment—a challenging but valuable life
skill!
Have you ever sat down and played a video game with your nephew or niece
or some other member of generation G, the gamer generation, and found
yourself with two left thumbs while they are succeeding right and left? This isn’t
luck; it is a skill that can be transferred to our classrooms and in daily life.
Today’s games are far more complex and demanding than the Pong of the past.
They require kids to multitask and handle multiple inputs at any given moment.
Games are rigorous, and they elicit the honing of vital skills, such as critical
thinking, intuition, and communication.
Bringing the positive, result-producing aspects of games to the classroom is
key to the intentional use of gamification. The goal is to design a series of
challenges that students will find worth exploring. In that exploration, their
learning goes well beyond the basics. Just like choice games do—the games
students choose to play at home—we can strategically make our game
components more challenging so that kids will stay engaged. In doing so, we
create a classroom environment that fosters the students’ desire to learn—
because learning feels like play.
Bringing the positive, result-producing aspects of games to the
classroom is key to the intentional use of gamification.
So let’s investigate why students play choice games like video games and
board games. No one makes them play; they do it on their own and in their free
time. As the gamer generation, their number one use of time is to play games.
They game more than TV, movies, and trips to the mall combined. By the time
our students complete high school, they will have gamed for more than 10,000
[2]
hours . As educators, we need to meet our learners where they are, and they
are gamers!
Let’s stop for a moment and think about what this $300 video game machine
really is. It is a little box that produces very difficult challenges and tasks to
solve. Honestly, doesn’t that seem like the worst birthday gift for your thirteen-
year-old? Hey, I bought you the best gift ever… I bought you a workbox. Yeah,
right!
Let’s compare the workbox to the class workbook. The video game machine
(workbox) and the class workbook are very similar when stripped down to the
basic components. Both have points, levels, cheats, and allow players to develop
over time through completing tasks or challenges. Yet the class workbook is
often uninspiring and demotivating. Why? One reason is that workbooks don’t
allow for choice. Game systems, on the other hand, incorporate choice and
motivational mechanics, such as questing, gaining access, and preserving the
open-ended process by giving agency over to the player. When we follow suit
and structure these elements into our content, student motivation and knowledge
acquisition increase. Building course work through the eyes of a game designer
will provide you with the insight necessary to create a New World of learning.
In the old world of education, choice games and our classes have little
connection in students’ minds. I have discovered several reasons for this. As
teachers, we have been trained to provide little challenge.
We are taught to model, model, and then model some more. By the time the
students get to create, they feel little motivation to do so. That ship has sailed,
usually more than once, and they want to move on to the next task. We also
show them “behind the curtain” too early in the acquisition process by giving
them rubrics that spell out each and every detail they will need to address to
succeed. What I have experienced is that overuse of rubrics encourages students
to create “inside the box” projects, instead of tapping into their creativity that
goes beyond what any rubric would measure. In my classroom, I want students
to create and perform from a place of passion and drive because that’s when they
are motivated to tackle the challenges of the content and assignments. Their
learning then takes hold in a greater way, which produces better results on
assessments and in students’ overall acquisition.
So, how can you enliven your content and course? Start doing what I call
playful planning. Literally, take your content and play with it; think of ways to
make it accessible to students that are “outside” the normal box of worksheets,
lecturers, reading materials, movie hour, etc. Then, engage your students on a
whole new level by allowing them to play with the content by infusing some of
the game mechanics within your course. Giving students opportunities to have
direct control over the game will result in players and students who feel
connected and inspired to dive deep into the content. When you do an activity
that is slightly out of the norm, the students, not knowing what to expect, will be
more vigilant and eager to participate, which only adds to the excitement of the
task. Harness the open-ended, non-scripted aspect of games and give the
students the autonomy to take a project where their interests lead.
Challenging your students engages them and creates a positive force for
learning. It’s about finding the flow. Game designers know that players walk
away from games that are either too easy or hard. Finding that “sweet spot” for
the gamer is what psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls flow found in
Flow and the Foundations of Positive Psychology. Flow is a state of heightened
focus and immersion one experiences while participating in activities such as art,
play, and work. Mihaly has devoted his life to the study of what makes people
truly happy and has discovered that flow is where the magic of happiness and
optimal performance meet. He defines flow as the creative moment when a
person is completely involved in an activity for its own sake. He says, “When we
are involved in [creativity], we feel that we are living more fully than during the
[3]
rest of life.” By using gamification, we can incorporate the power of flow into
our classrooms and encourage self-motivation and “happiness of doing” in our
students.
According to Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, people feel best
when they are at the perfect level of their skills: neither under-challenged
(boredom) nor over-challenged (anxiety and frustration). And, as people
learn with time and repetition, challenges have to increase to keep up with
growing skills. Source: Google Tech Talk I Sebastian Deterding, 2011
Teachers who only focus on the rigor and not the flow prevent their students
from achieving their full potential; rigor without flow is just hard for hard’s sake.
Grounding our intention in Csikszentmihalyi’s ideas, we can produce the right
results for our gamified classroom by fusing together the ideal amount of
content, choice, and challenge.
The three Cs of content, choice, and challenge are important to keep in mind
as we design the elements for game-based learning. Content is the curriculum
and required standards. Choice, in the open-ended game model, is an invitation
for students to explore unique, individual paths to content acquisition.
Challenges are the unknown twists and turns that keep the learner engaged
throughout the unit. Allowing for content, choice, and challenge to merge in a
way that puts the student in control is no easy task, and that is where an
intentional gamified structure is essential. You can structure a system that
encourages kids to explore, tackle what lies ahead, and, as Csikszentmihalyi’s
studies show, do it all with smiles on their faces.
MYTH #2
If I give them a badge or points, my class will be gamified.
TRUTH
Combining the many elements of game mechanics helps create
memorable experiences that push students well beyond the bounds of
the traditional classroom.
When I first started looking into the topic of gamification a few years back,
the only tools I could find were badges and points. Badges and points, without
an engaging setting or purpose, were not motivators for me or my students.
Monopoly is a good example of an engaging game with purpose. After each
round, you earn points and badges in the form of money and properties. These
rewards are exciting because there are other elements at play. First, there is
meaningful social interaction between the players inside the overarching
storyline or theme of the game. Second, there are the micro-goals, like free
parking, getting a set of properties, and building a real estate empire. Third, there
are the risks and challenges that result from your choices. All of those elements
combined make it something that kids and adults can play for hours. If the game
were simply about collecting points, Monopoly wouldn’t be one of the world’s
best-selling games; in fact, it would be boring. The same is true for our
classrooms.
You will learn in the pages ahead that points and badges are only two of the
many game mechanics that support gamified lessons, units, and courses. A
healthy gamified classroom must include a variety of elements that build upon
one another and create opportunities for effective communication and
collaboration among students.
MYTH #3
It’s easy for you. It won’t work for me because I teach ___________
[Fill in the Blank].
TRUTH
Gamification works for all grade levels, subject areas, and educational
budgets.
This myth is just plain bunk! I understand that you might not want to change
your class, or you have concerns about the time needed to make a change. But
saying you can’t gamify your class because of the subject you teach is simply an
excuse. Gamification is possible in any subject because it’s not as much about
the content as it is about engaging students in the learning process. Gamification
is successful in pre-kindergarten classrooms all the way up to advanced
placement and international baccalaureate classes because it connects content
with the way students act and think. The question shouldn’t be if you can
connect it to your content; it should be how you are going to connect to your
students. Take your subject, lay over the top of it a gamified structure that
motivates students, and you will start to see the true power of this educational
tool. Remember, this method is available to you no matter what grade, subject,
or diverse student body you teach. Yes, it will take time to create. It will force
you to think differently about your class. But one thing that it won’t be is
unavailable to your class due to your course topic.
MYTH #4
You need to be a gamer to gamify your class.
TRUTH
You do not have to be a gamer to get started.
An explorer is an explorer once she sets off on the voyage of discovery.
Likewise, you will be a gamer once you start to gamify your classroom. You will
find how accessible this method is when you invest the time to learn simple
game designs and mechanics while letting your creative winds blow. You will
continue to be motivated to build your newfound game knowledge because you
are creating a learning experience that is both unique and memorable.
Start building your ship ledger by doing a bit of fun research. Download the
latest or most popular game apps and start playing them. Note what aspects
engage you as possible elements to include in your classroom. Take note of the
overall game structure and specific goals and challenges. After doing this
research, your legal pad or digital document will be filled with random musings
that will provide a motivating starting point for your game design. Part III of this
book will provide you with additional ways to begin brainstorming ideas as well
as guided processes to struc"
